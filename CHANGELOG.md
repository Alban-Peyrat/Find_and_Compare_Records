# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.2] - 2025-03-14

### Added

* Added an info statement in logs to properly display when the matching process starts

### Fixed

* Updated `Koha_SRU` & `Abes_SRU` versions, including a fix preventing crashes when a generic exception was caught
* The matching process now supports logs from the modules it is using

## [2.0.1] - 2024-09-12

### Added

* User documentation now has an example showing how to install a library in Python
* The user interface now checks if the input file, the output folder and the log folder exist or can be created
  * If one of them does not exist, the user will stay in the main configuration window and an error pop-up will open
  * If one of the folder was created, the information will be written in the error pop-up or an informative pop-up (if there was no error)
* The main function now properly checks and displays in the terminal (and logs if available) if the input file, output folder or log folder do not exist or can not be created

### Fixed

* User documentation now correctly uses `BETTER_ITEM_MAPS` instead of `BETTER_ITEM_NO_MAPS`
* Processings `BETTER_ITEM_DVD` & `BETTER_ITEM_MAPS` do not look anymore only for dates in the origin database physical description (method `__special_better_item()`)
  * This behaviour is now an opt-in, the default one is keeping the data raw

## [2.0.0] - 2024-07-25

### Added

* Documentation now states which library versions were used for development (due to issues with `PySimpleGUI` in this project and `pymarc` in another project)
* Now uses `pysisbn` library
* Added error `ISBN_979_CAN_NOT_BE_CONVERTED` for ISBN 13 not starting with `978` if trying to convert them to ISBN 10
* Operations `SEARCH_IN_SUDOC_BY_ISBN`, `SEARCH_IN_SUDOC_DVD`, `SEARCH_IN_SUDOC_NO_ISBN` & `SEARCH_IN_SUDOC_MAPS` now have an additionnal last action that queries only on title on the title index (and document type filter)
* More specific erros were added if the title, the authors, the publisher or the dates were missing and they were required for the matching process and if the configured document type is not supported

### Changed

  * Python 3.12 (3.11 before)

* _Light grey_ color was replaced by _creme_
* Replaced ISBN functions from `Abes_id2ppn` by `pyisbn` library
* Updated `Abes_id2ppn` with lastest version
* Splitted big files into smaller ones & reduce dependencies between them
  * Notably, `cl_UDE.py` can now be used alone as it was originnally intended
  * Added a `classes_dependencies.md` file explaining the dependencies
* Reworked `request_action` to avoid redundacy on Sudoc SRU, Koha SRU & Sudoc's id2ppn webservice
* Documentation (developper & user) was updated (user english documentation was added)
